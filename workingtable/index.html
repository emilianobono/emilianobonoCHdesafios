        <p class="text0">Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps; others are happy to live with a very independent cat which spends most of its time outside and doesn’t want too much human interaction. <br> What is important is that you try to find a cat that will interact with you if you want it to. All cats are not the same and how each individual cat behaves with you can depend on its inherent personality and early experiences (or lack of experiences), which can make it fearful or confident with people and life in general. <br> While there is no guaranteed way to choose the perfect cat for you and your lifestyle, understanding your expectations as well as what makes cats tick will help you to bring home a cat that should be able to cope with its new environment and be the pet that you want too.</p>

                        <strong>Here's why you would prefer to share a house with a little feline:</strong><br> Cats are perfectly content lounging, napping, and playing with their toys at home alone while you work the day away. It's even better if you have two kitties since they'll keep each other entertained. Secondly, while cats certainly do make some noise—especially at night, when many cats are most active—meows and purrs tend to be pretty quiet.

                    <strong>The ABCs for housing a cat:</strong> You will need at least two litterboxes, as well as an additional box for every additional cat, with each box located in a different place in your home. If you have more than one cat, create multiple feeding and watering stations to decrease stress from competition. Additionally, providing various places for your cat to rest can help keep her out of spaces that are off-limits. Lastly, to help prevent scratching on inappropriate surfaces, like your couch, give your cat multiple acceptable areas to scratch.

        <h3 class="gridt3">About Us</h3>
        <p class="text1" >We are the proud fathers of 5 beautiful cats Samantha, Teo, Mona, Bixby, and Luz. Our little one, Luz was found abandoned at a car garage, with a broken back leg; so after we took her in, she had surgery and her whole leg was removed. Now she lives with only 3 legs, and she's able to do absolutely everything except jumping large distances. This web site originates out of our love for her (and all cats) and the desire to inform other people about how wonderfull it can be to have a disabled cat living at home.</p>
