            <h4 class="gallerytitles" id="area1">Visual Disability</h4>
            <p class="gallerytext">Cats have developed several unique vision features during their evolution that enable them to see clearly indoors and out. Unfortunately, these finely-tuned feline eyes are vulnerable to injury and a wide variety of diseases that can dramatically impair a cat’s eyesight or, in some cases, render a cat partially or totally blind. <br>
            The signs that your cat has become visually impaired may be quite obvious. The animal may, for example, start bumping into furniture, trip as it climbs up or down a flight of stairs, or appear to have trouble finding its litter box or food bowl. In some cases, however, the behavioral signs that something is going wrong with your cat’s vision may be too subtle to detect. It is recommended to have your cat’s eyes thoroughly examined periodically by your veterinarian. In addition, you should routinely monitor the health of your animal’s eyes. <br>
            If you are not sure about whether your cat might have visual impairment, you can look for changes in the color of the iris, for example, or see if the eye seems to be cloudy or if the cat’s two pupils appear to differ from one another; such changes can reveal a problem before it progresses to an irreversible stage.

            <h4 class="gallerytitles" id="area2">Movement Disability</h4>
            <p class="gallerytext">A spirited romp, an impressive leap, a lazy feline stretch — movement is vital to a cat's everyday life. And your cat's joint health is key to their ability to squirm and swipe and jump. Their joint health and mobility go hand in hand. <br>
            But if your kitty has a disease that affects their joints, or if they're older or overweight, they may experience joint issues that limit movement. Read on to learn what you, as a cat parent, should know about cat mobility and joint health for cats. <br>
            The two most common causes of reduced cat mobility are a decline in joint health and obesity. Obesity can speed up and worsen normal joint aging. However, cats of all sizes can experience joint issues at as early as 6 months old. <br>
            The most common reason for a decline in joint health for cats is degenerative joint disease (DJD), commonly referred to as osteoarthritis. DJD occurs when a cat's joint cartilage weakens and ultimately deteriorates. The absence of cartilage leads to the bones of the joints rubbing together, causing inflammation and pain, especially when a cat moves.

            <h4 class="gallerytitles" id="area3">Cognitive Disability</h4>
            <p class="gallerytext">
                According to Curtis Dewey, an associate professor of neurology and neurosurgery at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, feline neurologic disorders fall generally into the following categories: <br>
                - Epilepsy — This condition stems from defects in the electrical transmission of nerve signals within a cat’s cerebral cortex, the area of the brain responsible for thought, memory, sensation and voluntary muscle movement. Although this condition can be secondary to head injuries, metabolic irregularities or tumors, a relatively common form is termed idiopathic epilepsy — so named because there is no discernible cause for the violent seizures that an affected cat experiences. Cats with idiopathic epilepsy are typically normal in every other respect, says Dr. Dewey. Fortunately, epilepsy is usually manageable with the daily administration of various medicines. <br>
                - Congenital disorders — Among the most common of these is a condition affecting the cerebellum, the part of the brain responsible for muscle coordination. Some kittens that are born infected with the feline distemper virus will immediately show a severe lack of coordination. There is no cure for it, but cats with this neurologic problem can live a long life. Another congenital disorder, says Dr. Dewey, is hydrocephalus, a condition in which an abnormal accumulation of fluid can cause enlargement of the skull and compression of the brain. In some cases, he says, the condition can be successfully relieved by surgery that enables the drainage of excess fluid from a cat’s brain to its belly, from which it can then be excreted. <br>
                - Infectious disease — Cats that are infected with the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP) sometimes experience neurologic damage, says Dr. Dewey. “And there’s not too much that we can do to treat it,” he notes. Also, he notes, “We fairly frequently see cats with bacterial infections of the middle- and inner-ear cavities that break through the skull, which can result in a brain infection. Most of these cats will do all right if we catch the infection early.” <br>
                - Two other factors — trauma and advancing age — can play a substantial role in the sudden or gradual decline of feline neurologic well-being, says Dr. Dewey. “We often see cats that have been hit by cars,” he says. “Most of those that experience head trauma will die at the scene of the accident. But we sometimes see cats that almost escaped being hit but have had their tails run over. This can yank on the nerve roots, and in addition to having a dead tail, a cat that survives is likely to have urinary and fecal incontinence for the rest of its life.”<br>
                As for age-related neurologic problems, he says: “We don’t see a lot of them, but it’s well documented that old cats can develop a progressive degenerative disorder that kills brain cells. It’s similar to the problem experienced by elderly humans with Alzheimer’s disease.”

            <h4 class="gallerytitles" id="area4">Body Dysmorphic Disorder</h4>
            <p class="gallerytext">
                The frequency of individual defects varies with the species, breed, geographic location, season, and other environmental factors. Among domestic animals, cats have the lowest frequency of congenital defects. Some reported congenital and inherited defects in cats include lack of development of the cerebellum (a part of the brain critical for controlling balance), eye and eyelid defects, heart defects, cleft palate, failure of one or both testicles to descend into the scrotum (known as cryptorchidism), more toes than normal (polydactyly), and diaphragmatic and umbilical hernias. Most congenital defects have no clearly established cause; others are caused by genetic or environmental factors or interaction between these factors.
