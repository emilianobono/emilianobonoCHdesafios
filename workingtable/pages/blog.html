    <p class="blogp">Several years ago, Kelly noticed something unexpected in her yard. "We discovered a tiny orange kitten huddled in our bushes and his leg was dangling in a way that wasn't natural." The cat appeared to be homeless, but Kelly couldn't quite be sure, as the cat wouldn't come out. So, she left him food and water, hoping it would motivate him to trust her and her family. "We quickly realized, though, that this kitten needed medical help," she says. Her entire family attempted to coax him out of the bushes so they could take him to the veterinarian for treatment. "Ultimately, it took my brother-in-law lying down on our driveway and gently meowing at him until he came out!"
        <br>
    Kelly's vet believed that the kitten had most likely been hit by a car and would need a leg amputation. However, the vet thought he might also have a concussion, and his chance of survival was slim. Taking a chance, Kelly named the cat Milo and chose to have the surgery to remove the dangling limb. "Milo recovered largely while sitting on my lap throughout the days and was still terrified of everyone but me and one of our sons," she explains.
        <br>
    Was taking the chance on saving Milo's life by amputating his limb when survival wasn't necessarily promised worth it? Absolutely. Kelly says, "I wouldn't trade this cat for any other in the world. He has taught me so much about patience and love." In fact, Milo has inspired other humans to take a chance on cats with disabilities, especially amputees. Kelly notes, "A friend of mine, Jodi, fosters cats for the APL in Cleveland. She has fostered hundreds, often picking the ones that have significant challenges and may not survive—and virtually every one of them has survived as she and her husband love them along. The one type of cat she wouldn't foster: amputees. But, as she watched how well Milo has done, she decided to start fostering amputees, as well, and Jodi has told me that Milo has saved multiple cats because he gave her the courage to love them to wellness."</p>

    <h4 class="blogh41">Handicapped Cats: Dublin, Nickel + Tara's Story</h4>
    <p class="blogp1">When Tara adopted three-legged Dublin, she knew quite well what she was getting into. A lover of animals, she had previously loved and provided a home for another three-legged cat named Nickel who, unfortunately, died in 2015. When a friend called her to let her know there was a three-legged cat at a shelter in which he was volunteering his photography services, Tara certainly wasn't expecting to bring any new cats into her home. "I had already adopted two other four-legged cats after Nickel died," she says, "so I was hesitant, but I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I finally broke down and went to meet him." She ended up bonding with him immediately, decided to adopt him and brought him home that very same evening.
        <br>
    Her adoption of Dublin was similar to how she adopted Nickel years earlier. "I had gone to an SPCA with a friend to see a cat she found injured under her car ... and while we were there, she noticed this adorable gray kitten (he was maybe six months old) who seemed to be reaching out to us through the bars of the cage with his paw." It wasn't until Tara and her friend got closer to the cage that she realized the kitten was actually missing part of his paw. Since the shelter was waiting for an owner to claim the cat, Tara put her name down on the waiting list to adopt. When they called days later, Dublin's health was failing, and he had developed a fever. "I picked him up, took him straight to the vet, had what was left of that leg removed and then brought him home. Maybe three days later, still on pain killers, still all bandaged up, I found him on top of my armoire. To this day, I never figured out how he got up there, but nothing ever held him back."
        <br>
    Cats with disabilities search for love and affection from their owners just like any cat would, but Tara thinks this is especially true for amputees. "I have no idea if this is typical of three-legged cats, but (Dublin) is my lap cat, and so was Nickel. He is so friendly and warm and playful in a way that's just different than four-legged cats." She also finds that her amputee cats are very patient. "Dublin is—as Nickel was—the friendliest of the cats in our home, the most patient with my four kids, (9, 7, and 4-year-old twins), so that's saying a lot for any cat."
