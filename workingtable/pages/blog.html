        <p class="blogp">Several years ago, Kelly noticed something unexpected in her yard. "We discovered a tiny orange kitten huddled in our bushes and his leg was dangling in a way that wasn't natural." The cat appeared to be homeless, but Kelly couldn't quite be sure, as the cat wouldn't come out. So, she left him food and water, hoping it would motivate him to trust her and her family. "We quickly realized, though, that this kitten needed medical help," she says. Her entire family attempted to coax him out of the bushes so they could take him to the veterinarian for treatment. "Ultimately, it took my brother-in-law lying down on our driveway and gently meowing at him until he came out!"
            <br>
        Kelly's vet believed that the kitten had most likely been hit by a car and would need a leg amputation. However, the vet thought he might also have a concussion, and his chance of survival was slim. Taking a chance, Kelly named the cat Milo and chose to have the surgery to remove the dangling limb. "Milo recovered largely while sitting on my lap throughout the days and was still terrified of everyone but me and one of our sons," she explains.
            <br>
        Was taking the chance on saving Milo's life by amputating his limb when survival wasn't necessarily promised worth it? Absolutely. Kelly says, "I wouldn't trade this cat for any other in the world. He has taught me so much about patience and love." In fact, Milo has inspired other humans to take a chance on cats with disabilities, especially amputees. Kelly notes, "A friend of mine, Jodi, fosters cats for the APL in Cleveland. She has fostered hundreds, often picking the ones that have significant challenges and may not surviveâ€”and virtually every one of them has survived as she and her husband love them along. The one type of cat she wouldn't foster: amputees. But, as she watched how well Milo has done, she decided to start fostering amputees, as well, and Jodi has told me that Milo has saved multiple cats because he gave her the courage to love them to wellness."</p>
